Agentic AI Assistant
This is an Agentic AI project built using Python, LangGraph, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with ChromaDB, and Streamlit.
The system simulates a real-world AI assistant that can reason, retrieve knowledge, use tools, maintain memory, and apply safety controls.

Features
Chat-based user interface using Streamlit
Agentic workflow orchestration using LangGraph
Intent detection for understanding user queries
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using ChromaDB
Tool-based response generation (ATS scoring, memory, RAG)
Session memory (user name and question history)
Policy guardrails to block unsafe or restricted queries
Human-in-the-loop approval for high-risk intents
Confidence level estimation for generated responses

Summary
This project demonstrates a complete Agentic AI system with chat interaction, session memory, RAG using ChromaDB, tool execution, policy enforcement, and human-in-the-loop approval.
It showcases how modern AI assistants reason, retrieve knowledge, make decisions, and respond safely using an agent-based workflow rather than a simple prompt-based approach.
