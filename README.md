This project is an Agentic AI Assistant built using Python, LangGraph, RAG with ChromaDB, and Streamlit. It implements an agent-based workflow where the system detects user intent, maintains session memory, retrieves relevant knowledge using a vector database, and generates responses through appropriate tools rather than relying only on prompts. The assistant includes policy guardrails to block unsafe queries and uses a human-in-the-loop approval mechanism for high-risk actions, ensuring safe and controlled responses. Overall, the project demonstrates how modern AI assistants can reason, retrieve information, make decisions, and respond responsibly using an agentic architecture.
